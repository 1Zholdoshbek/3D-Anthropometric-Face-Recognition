We present a novel anthropometric three dimensional (Anthroface 3D) face recognition algorithm, which is based on a systematically selected set of discriminatory structural characteristics of the human face derived from the existing scientific literature on facial anthropometry. We propose a novel technique for automatically detecting 10 anthropometric facial fiducial points that are associated with these discriminatory anthropometric features. We isolate and employ unique textural and/or structural characteristics of these fiducial points, along with the established anthropometric facial proportions of the human face for detecting them. Lastly, we develop a completely automatic face recognition algorithm that employs facial 3D Euclidean and geodesic distances between these 10 automatically located anthropometric facial fiducial points and a linear discriminant classifier. On a database of 1149 facial images of 118 subjects, we show that the standard deviation of the Euclidean distance of each automatically detected fiducial point from its manually identified position is less than 2.54 mm. We further show that the proposed Anthroface 3D recognition algorithm performs well (equal error rate of 1.98% and a rank 1 recognition rate of 96.8%), out performs three of the existing benchmark 3D face recognition algorithms, and is robust to the observed fiducial point localization errors.
